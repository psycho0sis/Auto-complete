# ðŸš€ Welcome to my awesome project Auto-complete UI!

You should follow next steps to bundle the application:

1. ` npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `Open index.html with Live Server`
4. `Enjoy the app!`

Some recommendations:

1. After you enter your prefix you should use the Enter button to see the results.
2. If you see `Finish` - the search is over.
3. If you want to enter another prefix, you should delete the last one, press the Enter button and enter another prefix or you can complement the last one and press the Enter button again.

PS. It's my first try to use Classes to create the page, so, i did my best to create it correct.

Here is a deploy: https://autocompletepsycho0sis.netlify.app/
